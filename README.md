# PPS
## PPS Module for Python3.0
Quick fix for a friend's module that he converted from a V source of mine.

## How to use
Include the file in your project directory and import the file in your main project file
```
If you put it in the same directory as your main file -> from .pps import *
If you put it in a folder from your main file -> import pps
```
Call the `run()` function from the 'GetCurrent' class
```
PPS.run()
```
